## Description

### Overview

The Apache Kafka Connector connects to the Databus and Apache Kafka. The Connector can subcribes to MQTT Topics on Databus and produces messages (events, records) on a Kafka Topic. Also the Connector can consume messages from a Kafka Topic and publishes messages to MQTT Topics on Databus.

### General task

This example shows how to connect your Industrial Edge Device to Apache Kafka. Therefore a SIMATIC PLC is used as datasource. The OPC UA Connector reads the data from the PLC and publish them on Databus. The Apache Kafka Connector consists of two services, the "kafka-producer" and "kafka-consumer". The "kafka-producer" subscribes to the Databus, gets data from OPC UA Connector and produces messages in an Apache Kafka Broker's topic. The "kafka-consumer" subscribes to the same topic on the Apache Kafka Broker and publishes the data an other topic on Databus. The Flow Creator can be used to verify the data exchange between Industrial Edge and Apache Kafka.

## Requirements

### Used Components

- OS: Windows or Linux
- Docker minimum V18.09
- Docker Compose V2.0 â€“ V2.4
- Industrial Edge App Publisher (IEAP) V1.2.8
- Industrial Edge Management (IEM) V1.5.2-4 / V1.11.8
  - OPC UA Connector V1.8.1
  - Common Connector Configurator V1.8.1-4
  - Databus V2.0.0-4
  - Databus Configurator V2.0.0-5
  - IE App Configuration Service V1.2.2
- Industrial Edge Device (IED) V1.10.0-9

### TIA Project

The used TIA Portal project can be found in the [miscellaneous repository](https://github.com/industrial-edge/miscellaneous) in the tank application folder and is also used for several further application examples:

- [Tia Tank Application](https://github.com/industrial-edge/miscellaneous/tree/main/tank%20application)

### Prerequisites
Before using this application make sure you have a running Apache Kafka Broker. To setup up a test environment either follow the [Apache Kafka Quickstart guide](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) or use the provided [docker-compose.yml](./test/kafka-broker/docker-compose.yml) as described [here](./docs/installation.md#apache-kafka-broker-test-environment)

## Installation

You can find the further information about the following steps in the [docs](./docs)

- [Build application](docs/installation.md#build-application)
- [Upload application to Industrial Edge Management](docs/installation.md#upload-application-to-industrial-edge-management)
- [Configure and install application to Industrial Edge Device](docs/installation.md#install-application-on-industrial-edge-device)

## Usage

Connect your Industrial Edge Device to a PLC as datasource over the network.

Provide a Apache Kafka Broker (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)) that is accessible for the Industrial Edge Device over the network

Use e.g. Flow Creator to verify data exchange to and from Apache Kafka Broker.
